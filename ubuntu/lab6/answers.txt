Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations the ones with n=10

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations
